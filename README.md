# ChatGPTBOT
 
In today’s fast-paced world, accessing the right information quickly can make all the difference. That’s why I developed a Document Q&A Chatbot—a tool that allows users to upload documents and interact with them by asking questions to extract key insights.

💡 What makes this project stand out?
I leveraged the power of Streamlit and the ChatGPT API to create a solution that's not only powerful but also incredibly user-friendly. With Streamlit, I was able to build an intuitive web interface that makes document interaction as simple as drag-and-drop.

🔍 How does it work?
Using the advanced capabilities of the ChatGPT API, the chatbot processes uploaded documents and provides concise, contextually relevant answers to user queries. Streamlit handles the frontend beautifully, offering a seamless experience that bridges the gap between complex AI technology and everyday usability.
